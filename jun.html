      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><strong>Jun-A266</strong> is Noble Team's lone marksman and reconnaissance specialist—patient, pragmatic, and renowned for near-preternatural accuracy with the <em>Sniper Rifle System 99</em>.</p>
      <p>A fellow orphan of Covenant aggression, Jun volunteered for SPARTAN-III <em>Beta Company</em> and quickly distinguished himself on Sabre-cat insertion missions where stealth and surgical precision were paramount. His custom MJOLNIR Mk. V armor carries a hooded camouflage shroud and enhanced optics suite, reflecting his role as forward scout.</p>
      <p>During Reach's fall he provided overwatch at <em>SWORD Base</em>, spearheaded the civilian evacuation of New Alexandria, and served as Guardian sniper during <em>Operation: UPPER CUT</em>. Unlike the rest of Noble, Jun ultimately survived the campaign—tasked with escorting Dr. Catherine Halsey and critical ONI intel off-world. After the war he became chief instructor for the nascent Spartan‑IV program, ensuring his brothers' legacy endured.</p>
