      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><strong>Jorge-052</strong> stands out among Noble Team as both its sole SPARTAN-II and its heavy-weapons specialist. Born on the colony world Reach in 2511, Jorge was abducted into the original <em>SPARTAN-II</em> program and endured the demanding augmentation regimen that granted him super-human strength—and a towering 7&#39;4&quot; frame.</p>
      <p>Despite his imposing presence and M247H Heavy Machine Gun slung across his back, Jorge is thoughtful and quietly compassionate, often offering reassurance to civilians during evacuations. His MJOLNIR Mk. V armor features an integrated power pack and external ammunition canister to feed his weapon of choice.</p>
      <p>During the Battle of Reach he spearheaded <em>Operation: UPPER CUT</em>, a risky plan to cripple the Covenant supercarrier <em>Long Night of Solace</em> by detonating a slipspace drive in its core. On August 14, 2552, after repelling boarders in zero-G, Jorge manually deployed the reactor, shoving Noble Six to safety before the supercarrier—and himself—were consumed in the resulting slipspace rupture. His sacrifice destroyed the ship and temporarily blunted the Covenant fleet, buying Reach precious hours of resistance.</p>
