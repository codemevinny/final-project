      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><strong>Kat-B320</strong> serves as Noble Team's brilliant second-in-command and chief tactician. Recruited into SPARTAN‑III <em>Beta Company</em> after losing her family to Covenant attacks, Kat quickly earned a reputation for lightning-fast analysis and daring infiltration tactics.</p>
      <p>An earlier mission cost her left arm; she now wields an advanced cybernetic prosthetic integral to her custom MJOLNIR Mk. V suit, which also houses an upgraded data-link for on-the-fly network intrusion. Kat prefers speed and precision over brute force—often carrying a M6G sidearm and data-pad rather than heavy ordnance.</p>
      <p>On Reach she masterminded the intel heist at <em>SWORD Base</em> and co-authored plans for <em>Operation: UPPER CUT</em>. During the civilian evacuation of New Alexandria (August 12, 2552), Kat was struck and killed instantly by a Needle-rifle round from a Covenant Zealot sniper—an abrupt loss that rattled the remaining squad and underscored the brutal efficiency of the Covenant occupation.</p>
