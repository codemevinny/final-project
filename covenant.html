      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The <strong>Covenant</strong> is a theocratic alliance of alien species bound by a shared worship of the Forerunners and pursuit of the so-called <em>Great Journey</em>. By 2552—the events depicted in <em>Halo: Reach</em>—the alliance had waged a 27-year genocidal campaign against humanity, deeming them an affront to Forerunner divinity.</p>
      <p>Governed by the triumvirate of <em>Hierarchs</em> (Prophets Truth, Mercy, and Regret) from their mobile capital <em>High Charity</em>, day-to-day military operations were delegated to a High Council of Sangheili (Elites) and San'Shyuum (Prophets). Fleet actions on Reach fell under the Supreme Command of Fleet Master <strong>Thel 'Vadamee</strong> (the future Arbiter).</p>

      <h3>Legacy & Aftermath</h3>
      <p>The Covenant's victory at Reach was pyrrhic; although they glassed humanity's principal fortress-world, Noble Team's actions ensured the AI <em>Cortana</em> and the frigate <em>Pillar of Autumn</em> escaped to uncover Installation 04—setting in motion events that would fracture the Covenant three months later at Halo.</p>
