      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><strong>Emile-A239</strong> is Noble Team's close-quarters combat expert—fearless, confrontational, and instantly recognizable by the hand-carved skull motif adorning his gold visor.</p>
      <p>Raised amid Covenant raids, Emile channeled trauma into aggression, emerging from SPARTAN-III <em>Beta Company</em> with a reputation for relentless forward assault. His custom MJOLNIR Mk. V suit mounts extra ballistic plates, a kukri fighting knife on the pauldron, and a <em>M45 Tactical Shotgun</em> he wields with lethal proficiency.</p>
      <p>Throughout the Reach campaign, Emile provided heavy security during intel recoveries, served as tail-gunner in <em>Operation: UPPER CUT</em>, and escorted the <em>Pillar of Autumn</em> at the Aszod launch facility. On August 30 2552, while defending the slipspace-bound cruiser's launch tower, Emile was ambushed by a Sangheili Zealot wielding an energy sword. In the ensuing melee he killed one Elite before being mortally wounded by another—buying Noble Six precious seconds to complete the mission and safeguard Cortana.</p>
