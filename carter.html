      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><strong>Carter-A259</strong> is the calm and decisive Commander of Noble Team. Orphaned by Covenant aggression during the early Human-Covenant War, he was inducted into SPARTAN-III <em>Beta Company</em> and distinguished himself in covert operations before being hand-selected by Colonel Urban Holland to lead Noble Team on Reach.</p>
      <p>Known for his tactical acumen and unwavering loyalty to his squad, Carter pilots MJOLNIR Mk.V armor distinguished by a custom-painted blue visor stripe and hardened command uplink module. He values thorough reconnaissance and surgical strikes over brute force, though he is more than capable in direct engagements.</p>
      <p>During the Fall of Reach (July-August 2552), Carter oversaw critical missions ranging from investigating the Viery Territories communications blackout to escorting AI fragment <em>Cortana</em> toward the Pillar of Autumn. Despite severe injuries in the final evacuation push near Aszod Shipyards, he sacrificed himself by ramming a crashing Pelican into a Covenant Scarab, ensuring Noble Six and Catherine Halsey's AI made it off-worldâ€”pivotal actions that set <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> in motion.</p>
