      <h3>Biography</h3>
      <p><em>NOTICE:</em> Significant portions of Spartan-B312's personnel file have been <strong>redacted</strong> by the Office of Naval Intelligence (<abbr title="Office of Naval Intelligence">ONI</abbr>), Section III. Declassified fragments indicate B312 spent the majority of their operative life embedded in ONI black-cell units, undertaking direct-action raids and high-value target eliminations across the Outer Colonies. Their exact service chronology, mission codenames, and confirmed kill counts remain classified.</p>

      <p><strong>Spartan-B312</strong>, call-signed <em>Noble Six</em>, was transferred to Noble Team in July 2552 after the previous Six's fatal deployment. ONI's transfer order flagged B312 as a “hyper-lethal vector”––a rare designation previously bestowed only on Master Chief Petty Officer John-117. Although commanders welcomed the added combat potency, the move also served ONI's strategic aim of placing a field-asset in proximity to classified projects on Reach (namely <em>CORTANA</em>).</p>

      <p>Their MJOLNIR Mk.V armor was mission-tailored—helmet peripherals, chest rigs, and shoulder plates varied to accommodate reconnaissance, demolitions, or infiltration objectives, reflecting Six's elastic <abbr title="Military Occupational Specialty">MOS</abbr> within ONI's clandestine network. While taciturn with peers, Six maintained encrypted side-channel comms with ONI handlers throughout the campaign—channels that abruptly went dark after Reach fell.</p>

      <p>Throughout the Fall of Reach, Noble Six:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Neutralized the Covenant relay outpost in Viery Territory.</li>
        <li>Recovered critical ONI data alongside Kat at <em>SWORD Base</em>.</li>
        <li>Boarded and aided destruction of the supercarrier <em>Long Night of Solace</em>.</li>
        <li>Escorted evacuation columns in New Alexandria.</li>
        <li>Delivered the AI <em>Cortana</em> to the <em>Pillar of Autumn</em>, fulfilling Section III's contingency plan and enabling humanity's discovery of Halo.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>After ensuring Cortana's escape, Six declined exfiltration orders and remained planetside to cover the cruiser's departure. Surrounded by Covenant ground forces on September 22 2552 (post-glass), Noble Six fought to the end—his final biosign telemetry terminating amid weapons-lock chatter. ONI lists B312 as <em>KIA</em>, yet the file's last page contains a single handwritten epitaph: “<em>Spartans never die—</em>” (remainder classified).</p>
