    <section class="overview">
      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p><strong>Reach</strong> is Earth's closest interstellar neighbor at 10.5 light-years, terraformed in 2362 and designated Epsilon Eridani II. With rich titanium deposits and stable climate zones, it evolved into the United Nations Space Command's primary shipyard and training center—home to the <em>SPARTAN-II</em> program, <em>SWORD Base</em>, and orbital <em>Aszod</em> shipyards.</p>

        <li><strong>Aszod Shipbreaking Yards:</strong> Orbital elevator and frigate construction slips.</li>
        <li><strong>SWORD Base (Menachite Mountain):</strong> ONI research complex housing Cortana fragments.</li>

    <section class="importance">
      <h3>Strategic Importance to the UNSC</h3>
      <p>Reach's orbital yards produced over 60% of frontline frigates and carriers, while its military academies trained ODST and Spartan units. Its fall crippled humanity's fleet logistics and R&amp;D capacity mere weeks before the Covenant discovered Earth.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="legacy">
      <h3>Aftermath & Legacy</h3>
      <p>The near-total glassing rendered Reach uninhabitable, yet subterranean ONI caches (CASTLE Base) endured—later re-explored during <em>Operation: WHITE GLOVE</em> in 2553. Today Reach stands as a solemn memorial: a testament to Spartan sacrifice and a strategic lesson in the perils of centralized defense.</p>
